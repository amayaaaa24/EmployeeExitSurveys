# ExployeeExitSurveys

In this project, our objective was to analyze two exit surveys conducted by employment departments in Australia. By combining and aggregating the data from these surveys, we gained valuable insights into the factors influencing employee resignations. The key findings from our analysis are as follows:

1. Employees with longer tenures were more likely to resign due to dissatisfaction. This suggests that dissatisfaction tends to increase over time for individuals who have been with the organization for an extended period.

2. Among various job roles, the position of Guidance Officer had the highest percentage of dissatisfaction. This highlights the need for organizations to address specific issues and concerns related to this role to improve employee satisfaction and retention.

3. The dissatisfaction percentages were found to be similar between male and female employees. This indicates that gender does not significantly impact the likelihood of resignation due to dissatisfaction.

4. Younger employees, particularly those below 20 years of age, displayed a lower tendency to resign due to dissatisfaction. This may be attributed to factors such as career stage, job expectations, or other unique circumstances.
